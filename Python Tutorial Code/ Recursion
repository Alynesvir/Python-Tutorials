# recusion (a function that calls itself directly or indirectly)
# Performing the same operations multiple times with different inputs.
# In every step, we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller.
# Base condition is needed to stop the recursion otherwise infinite loop will occur.
# Write a recursive program count_sum that returns the sum of all integer numbers from 1 to n.

def count_sum(n):
    if n==1: # base case
        return 1
    else:
        return n+count_sum(n-1) # recusive case
